# FileCompressor
This project implements lossless file compression using Huffman coding. It reads input files, calculates character frequencies, builds a Huffman tree, and generates binary codes to compress data. The goal is to reduce file size efficiently while preserving data integrity and to illustrate real-world use of compression algorithms.
